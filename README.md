# BookSwap

BookSwap is an app that allows you to trade books with people in your community. In this app you have the ability to find, search, upload, and trade books with fellow book lovers. All trade requests, messages, updates, or changes made in the app are reflected in real-time. 

## Details about the app

BookSwap is currently in progress and the following is a list of things I'm working on:

- Architecting the app in MVVM
- Utilizing Firebase Realtime Database to persist user data, books, and messages 
- Integrating third party frameworks and tools such as Alamofire, AlamofireImage, and MGSwipeTableCell
- Accessing Google Books API to search and retrieve books
- Creating views in Xibs and using Auto Layout
